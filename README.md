# Friend-Finder!

This app is a full-stack site using node.js and express.js which takes in results from users' responses to 10 statement (responses are ranked from 1, "strongly disagree," to 5, "strongly agree,") and compares their answers with those from other users. The app calculates the best match (the one with the least difference in responses), and will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
